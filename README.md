#Accion

Accion is an attempt to collate a list of official and/or recognisable accessibility icons, and provide them in SVG and webfont formats.

##Examples
- Audio Descriptive
- Sign Language
- BSL (British Sign Language)
- etc.

Whilst some of these may have limited use on the web, there is nothing to stop the font being used for offline applications, and with the uptake of interactive displays, there may be alternative digital uses.

##Contribution
I would welcome any contributions, in any form, by anyone. 
- Adding to the list of icons to be included
- Referencing source/example signs
- Creating SVGs
- Adding to the font
- Whatever else you can think of...
